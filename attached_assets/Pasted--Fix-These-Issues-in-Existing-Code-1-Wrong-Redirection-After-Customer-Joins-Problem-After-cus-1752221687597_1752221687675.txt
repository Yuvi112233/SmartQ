🔧 Fix These Issues in Existing Code:
✅ 1. Wrong Redirection After Customer Joins
Problem:
After customer enters name & phone, they're being sent straight to the "Your Turn" page.

Fix Required:

After submitting the form on /customer, redirect to /customer/queue, not /customer/now.

The logic to redirect to /customer/now should only trigger when the backend confirms it is actually their turn (position = 1).

This check should happen periodically (polling or Socket.IO).

✅ 2. Navbar Cleanup & Authorization Fix
Problem:

Two similar buttons: “Barber Panel” and “Admin” – both do the same thing

No authorization applied on Barber Panel

Fix Required:

Remove “Admin” button from navbar completely

Apply login/auth middleware to /barber

If user is not logged in, redirect to /barber/login

Once logged in, show /barber/dashboard

In navbar: clicking “Barber Panel” should redirect to /barber/login if not authenticated

✅ 3. Logo Should Route to Home
Problem:
No way to return to homepage from internal views

Fix Required:

Make the SmartQ logo in navbar clickable

On click → navigate to homepage /

✅ 4. Barber Panel Must Be Authorized
Fix Required:

Create an auth-protected login route: /barber/login

Accept username + password

Save session/token to authorize admin access

Only show the dashboard (/barber/dashboard) if logged in

✅ 5. WhatsApp Integration Enforcement
Problem:
Even after login, WhatsApp isn’t checked or required

Fix Required:

After login success, check WhatsApp session (via Baileys)

If WhatsApp is connected:

Allow full access to dashboard

If NOT connected:

Blur dashboard (disable interactions)

In center, show message:
❗ “Please log in to WhatsApp to manage queue.”
With a reconnect button

Reconnect automatically or show persistent login session

✅ 6. Only Barber Should Control Progression
Problem:
Customers are auto-sent to “Your Turn” page even when barber didn’t call them

Fix Required:

Customers should only see /customer/now when barber clicks “Call Next”

Barber clicks “Call Next Customer”:

Sends WhatsApp message

Triggers backend flag on that customer: status: "called"

That specific customer is redirected to /customer/now

Until then, they stay on /customer/queue

🧠 Additions for Clarity & UX:
🌐 Navbar (Final):
Home (/)

Customer (/customer)

Barber Panel (/barber/login) → redirects to dashboard after login

🧪 Backend APIs That Need to Be Updated:
POST /api/barber/login → check admin credentials

GET /api/whatsapp/status → check WhatsApp session live

POST /api/whatsapp/login → reconnect WhatsApp (if session invalid)

POST /api/queue/call-next → called by barber → mark customer status: "called"

GET /api/queue/customer/:phone → check if it’s their turn

POST /api/customer/reached/:phone → mark customer as “Reache
